THE SEVEN LAYERS OF decision tree management

The processing of player decisions is a critical function, with each choice being meticulously routed to several key game systems. Specifically, player-initiated actions are not only directed to the turn engine for immediate resolution and advancement of the game state, but are also simultaneously transmitted to The Ledger. This ensures a comprehensive and auditable record of all player activities, contributing to the integrity and long-term consistency of the game world. Furthermore, certain player decisions are also channeled to a specific in-game persona, Raymond Reddington, implying a layer of dynamic interaction and potential consequences stemming from this character's involvement.

The majority of player actions serve as triggers for various in-game feedback mechanisms. Actionable cues are generated, providing players with immediate and explicit feedback regarding the outcome or direct effects of their choices. Complementary to these are implicit cues, which may be more subtle environmental changes or narrative hints that indirectly reflect the player's actions, fostering a sense of a reactive and dynamic game world. Additionally, many actions result in definitive cues or statements, which are clear and unambiguous pieces of information communicated to the player.

These diverse cues and statements are not solely for the player's consumption; they are also strategically directed to the core game systems: the turn engine, The Ledger, and Raymond Reddington. Routing these cues back to the turn engine allows for complex chain reactions and ensures that the game state evolves logically in response to player input. Simultaneously feeding this information to The Ledger reinforces the persistent record-keeping of game events and player behavior. Finally, the transmission of cues to Raymond Reddington suggests that this character's actions and responses are dynamically influenced by the unfolding events and player choices. This multi-directional flow of information ensures the robustness of the game logic, where every player decision reverberates through the system, and also facilitates the embedding of hooks for future narrative developments, emergent gameplay, and personalized experiences.

Layer 1:     Philosophical Orientation
             (What is the general worldview and orientation behind your system?)

Layer 2:     Guiding Principles
             (What hard-coded rules or commitments are you adhering to?)

Layer 3:     Core Doctrines
             (What belief systems or tenets are being enforced or maintained?)

Layer 4:     Operational Mandates
             (What policies are required in order to function and execute actions?)

Layer 5:     Regulatory Policies
             (What rules must be followed within this system or jurisdiction?)

Layer 6:     Strategic Implementations
             (What strategies are currently being deployed or in effect?)

Layer 7:     Tactical Enforcements
             (What methods are used to ensure compliance and action?)


This is a brainstorm of trying to figure out how to make the pipeline that feeds to the reveal at the end. This is all internal system facing.

the internal decision analysis pipeline that culminates in a narrative or psychological reveal (e.g., Redington's commentary or a behavioral dossier log). This is not player-facing directly, but it feeds the player-facing moment by structuring the underlying logic trail.

Let‚Äôs break this down in terms of purpose, scope, and next-phase development for the internal pipeline you're modeling:

üîÅ Purpose of This Internal System
Track every stage of the player‚Äôs decision with interpretive context

Determine impact and intent alignment (emotional + strategic)

Assign significance and routing to decisions (e.g., log silently, show commentary, inject into narrative)

Feed structured metadata into the narrative engine (Redington or game memory)

Support circular analysis: everything feeds back into the next turn‚Äôs initialization

üß† Core Modules in the Pipeline (As Implemented)
Each of these functions as a ‚Äúvalidator‚Äù or ‚Äútagger‚Äù:

Initialization ‚Üí Reset memory, profile context

Decision Layers (1‚Äì7) ‚Üí Frame ideological weight

Decision ID ‚Üí What action was actually taken

Anchor Point ‚Üí What logical node triggered the analysis (policy? anomaly?)

Intent ‚Üí What was the player trying to do (inferred from doctrine + action)

Outcome ‚Üí Result: success, failure, partial

Post-Decision Behavior ‚Üí Did they adapt or double down?

Impact Assessment ‚Üí Emotional, strategic, aggregate level

Emotional Payload ‚Üí Should Redington say something, and if so, how?

Hook Metadata ‚Üí Build JSON to tag the hook

Routing ‚Üí Where does the hook go (log, Redington, dossier)?

Complete ‚Üí If all tags assigned, close the loop and restart

üß© What This Is Missing (for Full Reveal-Triggering Pipeline)
 optional but strategic additions that bridge internal logic to Redington‚Äôs final reveal moment:

Function	Purpose	Suggested Implementation
Memory Weighting	Assign score to decision chain for significance	Use a rolling ‚Äúimpact memory‚Äù array ‚Äî track top 3 weighted moments per cycle
Reveal Conditions	Gate whether Redington should comment	Require high-impact + contradiction + emotional delta
Narrative Hook Builder	Build text for Redington to use	Feed core doctrine, action taken, outcome, and tone into template generator
Persistent Turn Linkage	Track cross-turn themes	Tag each decision with theme_id if it belongs to a pattern
Reveal Type Selector	Choose between reflection, accusation, insight, etc.	Based on intent+emotion gap and doctrine violation logic
