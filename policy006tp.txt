[Intro Sequence]
   ├── Reddington’s Monologue: Sets dystopian tone, region-specific context (e.g., “Keystone States: Pharmaceutical powerhouse faces energy crisis”)
   ├── Region-Specific News Feed: Simulated X posts (e.g., “Northern Frontier: Water scarcity threatens growth”)
   └── Transition to Game Loop
   ↓
[Game Loop (~20 turns)]
   ├── [Turn Start]
   │    ├── Display Survival Metrics: Food, Security, Stability (influenced by region’s resources, e.g., Heartland’s corn = high food security)
   │    ├── Reddington’s Commentary: Contextual advice (e.g., “Diversify energy imports, Keystone States”)
   │    └── Region-Specific Events: Crises tied to bottlenecks (e.g., “Oil shortage in Great Lakes Federation”)
   │
   ├── [Player Actions]
   │    ├── Allocate Resources via Resource Card: Manage abundant/scarce resources (e.g., Oil for Sierra Mesa, Water for Northern Frontier)
   │    ├── Adjust Governance via Governance Card: Optional mid-game shift (e.g., from Agrarian Cooperative to Technocracy in Heartland)
   │    ├── Diplomacy/Trade: Form alliances based on Role in Alliances (e.g., Keystone States as pharmaceutical supplier)
   │    └── Infrastructure Investments: Address bottlenecks (e.g., desalination for Sierra Mesa)
   │
   ├── [Outcome Resolution]
   │    ├── Calculate MIC Score: Based on resource allocation, production modifier (–1 to +1), and trade outcomes
   │    ├── Apply Region-Specific Modifiers: e.g., +1 for Keystone States yields 1.5x farmland output
   │    └── Update Abundance Scores: Reflect resource management (e.g., water scarcity reduces Heartland’s stability)
   │
   ├── [Narrative Feedback]
   │    ├── Reddington via Assistant Card: Provides strategic insights (e.g., “Heartland’s water crisis demands action”)
   │    ├── News Feed Updates: Reflect player choices (e.g., “Sierra Mesa secures oil trade deal”)
   │    └── Kumo Profile Updates: Tracks player tendencies (e.g., “Innovative Diplomat” for Keystone States)
   │
   ├── [Event Trigger]
   │    ├── Crises: Region-specific (e.g., “Water shortage in Northern Frontier”)
   │    ├── Opportunities: Alliance or trade deals (e.g., “Great Lakes Federation exports automobiles to Coastal Confederate”)
   │    └── Random Events: Global disruptions (e.g., “Energy market crash affects Keystone States”)

   └── [End Turn]
        ├── Update Metrics: Stability, Food, Security
        ├── Advance Turn Counter
        └── Check Endgame Conditions (e.g., 20 turns or collapse)
   ↓
[Endgame Transition]
   ├── Reddington’s “Revelation”: Reflects on player’s legacy (e.g., “Sierra Mesa: Energy titan or overextended empire?”)
   ├── Kumo Profile Reveal: Summarizes player style (e.g., “The Heartland: Resilient Agrarian Leader”)
   └── Outcome Summary: Metrics, alliance status, narrative impact
   ↓
[Endgame Outcome]
   ├── Victory: Alliance dominance, high stability (e.g., Keystone States leads pharmaceutical alliance)
   ├── Collapse: Resource depletion, instability (e.g., Northern Frontier succumbs to water scarcity)
   └── Partial Success: Mixed outcomes (e.g., Great Lakes Federation thrives industrially but faces energy constraints)
