Make a plan to organize POLICY in my custom way 


ChatGPT said:
To organize POLICY in your custom way—with modular control, deterministic traceability, and deployment-readiness—we’ll build a 4-tier organization system that mirrors your development style and system logic.

SXV8: ORGANIZATION PLAN FOR “POLICY”
MODE: SXV8
CONTEXT: POLICY Architecture Management
FOCUS: Custom Modular Organization Plan

TIER 1: MASTER STRUCTURE – DOMAIN BRANCHES
Break the game into six master branches based on function and design authority.

TIER 2: MODULE IDENTIFICATION
Each module is labeled using:

less

[ModuleName]_[Number]  
Status: Validated | In Progress | Draft  
Tags: [system-type], [subsystems], [linked modules]
Example:

Edit
{
  "Module": "GovernanceCycleModule_4",
  "Status": "Validated",
  "Tags": ["governance", "calendar", "population"],
  "Dependencies": ["Turn Engine", "PopulationModule_6"]
}
TIER 3: INTERNAL MODULE FORMAT (A1/A2/A3)
Every module follows the structure:

A1: Full documentation (7 required sections)

A2: Unity-compatible or Python logic (deploy-ready)

A3: JSON Mediator schema (5 fields minimum)

This ensures:

Portability across systems

Verifiability through validation logic

Seamless integration with Router/CNS/Turn Engine

TIER 4: SYSTEM-LEVEL BOARDS (FOR YOU)
Organize in your Notion, Airtable, or GDrive with the following boards:

1. Module Manifest
One row per module

Status, version, last change, lead system

2. Governance Control Grid
Grid with rows = governance models, cols = impact areas (Trade, MIC, CLA, etc.)

3. Assistant Drift Tracker
Per-assistant scoring delta, alignment over time, audit logs

4. Flashpoint/Event Tracker
Event ID, triggering metric, linked governance outcome, voiceover hook

5. Deployment Readiness Tracker
Columns: A1 (Doc), A2 (Code), A3 (Mediator), Router Path, CNS Sync, Ledger Hook

NEXT ACTIONS
Lock in your Module Manifest master list (I can regenerate this fully)

Choose primary storage: Notion, Airtable, or CSV base

Decide if you want a CLI validator tool to check module readiness before export

Begin enforcing version naming (_1A, _1B) and link dependency mapping

Would you like me to:

Regenerate the full module list in this structure?

Begin creating the Notion board templates or CSV layout?

Build a Python validator to check A1/A2/A3 integrity?

Your move.

only organizing it now because i'm about to make sure it's all saved correctly somewhere away because i just ran into a critical like memory memory error here and it scared shit out of me so what i need is this first of all i want to organize it by parts by engine parts basically so the cns the cns i need i'ma modulize it and the things on it the cns has the uh ledger on it and it has something else on it i'm not remembering it's uh it has a error error handling portion that has the ledger on it and some other stuff the module list that feeds into the cns the a1 a2 a3 i have that entire module list so that's another section then i have another section i need to have the router and uh i need to have the router there manifest and i think that was it it was something else over there if i'm not mistaken but i want to make sure then we have the turn engine which has the uh it has the ledger the other half of the ledger on it it also has the war matisse in it uh war lattice i think was what you called it and i have that information on there as well if it's anything else that i'm forgetting while i'm saying it let me know then we have the ui tour you know human facing ui that comes from the turn engine and we also have uh anything else i'm forgetting about that we're you know all outside stuff like oh no that's user interface stuff the things that show outward like the these startup screens and uh you know the cards and all that go in in that section as well now take those things and separate it by component area and add anything that i'm forgetting
ChatGPT said:
Updated saved memory
Got it, that’s critical to lock down. Here's the full breakdown by engine part, organized exactly how you described—plus anything you might’ve missed:

1. CNS (Central Node System)
Main Role: Data transport, error distribution, ledger relay

Contains:

Ledger Handler (receives data from all modules)

Error Processor (collects from Error Module, finalizes logs)

Grand Schema Aggregator (builds unified module schema from Mediators)

Feeds Into: Turn Engine

2. ROUTER
Main Role: Initial intake, schema validation, manifest registration

Contains:

Router Manifest (all valid module schemas)

Pass-through validator (enforces schema match before forwarding to CNS)

Possible Missing Piece: If you enabled hook routing, Router may also log unhooked (unused) modules for audit

3. MODULE SET (A1/A2/A3 Systems)
Main Role: Modular source-of-truth logic, piped via Mediators

Includes:

Full library of modules (GovernanceModule_9, TradeModule_8, etc.)

Each with A1 (Doc), A2 (Logic), A3 (Mediator Schema)

Each schema feeds into CNS → then Turn Engine

4. TURN ENGINE
Main Role: Game logic execution per turn (weekly phases)

Contains:

Second half of the Ledger (reconciles adjustments and scores)

War Lattice (conflict trigger logic and threshold events)

ConfigModule (embedded here, not CNS, for drift prevention)

Flashpoint & Trigger Logic (responds to unresolved issues)

Hook System (sends data to Final Reveal or Redington hooks)

5. UI / USER-FACING SYSTEMS
Main Role: Display, interaction, onboarding

Includes:

Startup Screen / Splash + UI transitions

Assistant Cards (Red/Yellow/Green tier display)

Assistant Interaction Logic (toggle + NLU input)

Monthly Summary Screens (resolution turn)

Final Reveal Interface (Redington Dossier)

POSSIBLE MISSING PIECES
Here’s what else might be part of the system but wasn’t named yet:

Mediator Layer: Every module has a Mediator schema that sits between module and CNS

Error Module: The actual source of system-wide error messages, routes to CNS

Region Definitions: Stored canonically and required by population/trade modules

Trade Graph / Interaction Bar: Sits in UI layer but pulls from TradeModule and Assistant logic

Parable System: Voiceover + commentary logic tied to psychological triggers

Audit Engine: Tied to Turn Engine and Assistant System, supports once-per-year audits

I can now prepare a version of this in a structured format (like CSV, JSON, Notion-ready table, or visual map). How do you want it saved first?

You said:
I want you to put Reddington's whole voice, his voice, his parables, the timing of when he speaks, his whole voice thing. Reddington himself is a module. That way I can put his voice things, everything that has to do with his voice and speech in that module. I can put everything that has to do with his psychological hooks and how they feed to him in that module. And I can also put the whole panel six because that's his window in that module. So if I put all of those in that module, that's fine. I need a visual diagram and I wanted it marked down too.

You said:
Beautiful visual.  Now map the components in the 6 departments 
ChatGPT said:

Would you like this pushed into one of those formats now?

You said:
Now, can all of the departments have their components inside or can all of the departments be managed with their internal parts the same way we did the modules with A1 being documentation, A2 being all code, A3 being any miscellaneous or supplemental pieces to it? For example, if one of them is visualizations, it may not need a mediator, A3, so like the modules do, but that A3 can mean something else.
ChatGPT said:
Yes—absolutely, and it’s clean to do it that way. You can apply the A1 / A2 / A3 format to every department, even though not every department or component will use it the same way.

Think of A1–A2–A3 as a universal interface pattern rather than a fixed module structure. Here's how it scales across departments:

A1 → Documentation
Always included. Every department or component should have:

System role summary

Dependencies

Interaction map

Versioning notes

Known limitations

So, CNS would have cns.md, Router would have router.md, etc.

A2 → Core Logic or Executable
This is your implementation payload:

For CNS: Python or Unity script that dispatches payloads

For UI: Visual rendering engine or logic scripts

For Redington: Speech timing handler or voice event triggers

Not everything will be Python. Some might be Unity C#, YAML, or flow logic.

A3 → Supplement / Extension / Mediator
Flexible by department:

In Modules, A3 is the mediator schema

In CNS, A3 could be a schema diff checker or visualization output

In UI, A3 might be .svg mockups, image assets, or interaction maps

In Redington, A3 might include:

parable_timing.yaml

hooks_map.json

Voiceover audio directory pointer

In Router, it could be a manifest diff report or JSON validity matrix

Here’s the formal mapping logic:
Department	A1 (Documentation)	A2 (Executable Logic)	A3 (Supplement)
CNS	cns.md	cns_dispatcher.py	cns_schema_aggregator.py or viz exports
Router	router.md	router_validator.py	router_manifest.json, hook log
Modules	trade.md	trade_logic.py	trade.json (Mediator schema)
Turn Engine	turn_engine.md	turn_engine.py	flashpoint_config.yaml
UI	ui_docs.md	ui_handler.py or .cs	.svg, .png, .flowchart.json
Redington	reddington.md	voice_engine.py	parable_timing.yaml, panel_six_spec.md

Would you like me to auto-generate one department in full A1/A2/A3 structure right now as a template? You could pick Redington, CNS, or UI, and I’ll lay out the files.

You said:
This still leaves one last part. In the build that we're using now, I have A1, A2, A3, but then there's a notes section. The notes section can be used as well. Now, I believe that it's a smart thing for us to do for every component, every payload, every department, you know, to have something in that module it's set, no matter where it is and what it is, to convert its language to the language that it needs to be in to go to Unity. And if we are turning everything to Unity in SJSON, then that means that we can use the notes section in departments that don't have mediators or in departments that are not the module set up for A1, A2, A3, to use the notes section to turn that data into the universal language of our build, will that work.  Or do I leave the note section just as notes and build one more department in there as AX and that x layer for a will always be a translator
ChatGPT said:
Yes—what you just outlined is structurally sound and scalable. Both options work, but Option 2 (introducing AX) is stronger for long-term clarity, modular control, and automation compatibility.

Let’s break down the two approaches and choose intelligently.

Option 1: Use NOTES Section as Translator
Pros:

Keeps things compact

Leverages existing documentation field

Easy to implement in flat structures like Markdown or Airtable

Cons:

Not functionally distinct (hard to trigger automation or code from it)

Could mix metadata, reminders, and functional output (risk of corruption or confusion)

Doesn't scale cleanly to automation, Unity export, or validation logic

Option 2: Create a Formal AX Layer (Translator Layer)
AX stands for:

“Adaptation Extension” or “Asset eXchange”

Each department or component now has:

A1: Docs

A2: Code

A3: Schema / Assets / Supplemental

AX: Universal Translator Layer – converts module data into Unity-bound SJSON, ScriptableObject-ready output, or Unity C# script templates

AX Responsibilities:
Role	Output Example
Unity Prep (SJSON)	Convert logic/state/schema into Unity-safe format
Voice Mapping	Map Reddington dialogue IDs into Unity cue entries
Asset Linking	Bind assets to Unity paths or resource folders
Flow Conversion	Turn hook or UI logic into Unity animation/stateflow
Flag Export	Pre-calculate what Unity needs to read at runtime

RECOMMENDED SYSTEM STRUCTURE (A1–A2–A3–AX + Notes)
Layer	Description	Required?	Unity Integration
A1	Full system/module documentation	Yes	No
A2	Core logic implementation	Yes	Yes (via AX)
A3	Supplement or schema (e.g., JSON, SVG, YAML, etc.)	Yes	Yes (via AX)
AX	Unity translator: exports code/data as SJSON, Scriptable	Yes	Yes
Notes	Developer commentary, inline TODOs, iteration history	Optional	No (ignored)

Real Example (RedingtonModule)
A1: reddington.md → Narrative role, parable timing, behavior criteria

A2: voice_engine.py → Dialogue trigger logic

A3: parable_timing.yaml, hook_map.json

AX:

panel_six.sjson

parables.asset (Unity asset references)

final_reveal.timeline.cs

Notes: “Still tuning cadence on aggressive hooks during week 3; test hook ID 423A triggers twice.”

Conclusion
Use AX. Make it a permanent, required field across all components.
Leave Notes as human-readable and non-functional.

Would you like me to generate a full AX template right now (e.g., what it looks like for Redington or CNS), so you can begin locking in that pattern immediately?

You said:
If we use the AX format, then all the work we've done with the modules, with A1, A2, A3, even though A3 is a mediator, it's still internal mediator. It's the mediator to put it on the CNS. So that way, we don't have to worry about the AX in the modules because those modules don't directly go into Unity. With the AX, we can manage that by addition. We can additionally add the AX layer if we have to convert it to Unity, or we can leave that to the CNS to convert it to Unity in the sub-module domain. Whatever the case is, we can always add the AX and still keep the structure we've already built clean and scalable and workable. But using notes introduces a level of maybe confusion. But an AX across the board from here on out guarantees that if you can look down into that AX session, and that will break it from whatever we're doing to Unity.
ChatGPT said:
Exactly. That’s a clean, deterministic call.

You're right on all fronts:

Modules (A1/A2/A3) already funnel through the CNS, and their A3s are internal mediators, not Unity-ready assets.

Unity conversion should never live inside NOTES—that adds ambiguity and breaks functional separation.

Introducing AX as a clean fourth layer across the system gives you:

A guaranteed export surface for Unity

A universal translation checkpoint

A standardized path for breaking JSON, Python, YAML, or CSV into SJSON or ScriptableObject-friendly forms

✅ FINAL STRUCTURE (Locked)
Every department, component, or payload now follows:

Layer	Description	Unity Role
A1	Full documentation (7-phase spec or system doc)	No
A2	Executable logic (code/script)	Source
A3	Supplementary schema (e.g., mediator, asset map)	Source
AX	Unity translator layer (e.g., .sjson, .asset, .cs)	Direct Input
Notes	Non-executable dev commentary	No

And for modules:

AX is optional but always allowed

CNS and Turn Engine can handle Unity formatting from AX directly

You preserve clean integration without disrupting mediator logic

Your Advantage Going Forward:
You can write and store AX generators independently, even per governance type, assistant, region, or parable.

If Unity rendering fails, you only debug AX. The rest of the logic remains untouched.

You now have a universal drop-in interface for any Unity object export, without ever polluting logic or structure.

Would you like me to prepare a starter AX template for a real module or system now? You pick the example—Redington, Turn Engine, UI, or even a single assistant—and I’ll scaffold it in AX format.

You said:
What I want you to do is grab those components out of the six different areas, minus the modules. We've already did that. And I want you to create a uploadable schema that I can use in Airtable that has the A1, A2, A3, and AX. You know, it has that framework in there with notes and the other things that we had. And I think it was like module number and the rest of it. But at least give me the A1, A2, A3, AX. And then if I upload all of that through CSV, I don't care about the rest of it. I can do that manually. The hardest part, I swear the hardest part is the A2 module being able to upload or to merge or to append code with triple quotes or whatever we need to use. The hardest part is putting that in there, because that makes the CSVs really long and it starts to play with line breaks.

Each cell has been line-break protected, and A2 code fields are stored safely for merging or future appending. Let me know if you want this expanded or templated for other systems. 

You said:
Tell me, what is the cleanest, most absolute, you know, straightforward, cleanest way to be able to upload multiple A2 batches?
ChatGPT said:
Alright—the cleanest, most bulletproof way to upload multiple A2 batches (code blocks with line breaks) into Airtable via CSV is to follow these exact constraints:

✅ Recommended Format for A2 in CSV
1. Wrap every A2 block in triple double-quotes (""")
This ensures line breaks are preserved inside the cell.

csv
Copy
Edit
"A2"
"""def trigger_war(threshold):
    if threshold > 80:
        return 'war'
    return 'peace'"""
2. Escape any internal triple quotes or CSV-breaking characters
Avoid triple quotes inside the code. If needed, use ' or \".

3. Ensure your CSV editor or generator encodes in UTF-8 and doesn’t wrap lines
Pandas does this right. Excel, not always—it may rewrap or break on newline unless specifically exported using "UTF-8 with BOM."

4. Use .csv upload into Airtable with “Custom Field Mapping”
Map A2 to a Long Text field in Airtable and allow rich text or pre formatting.

🔄 Optional Alternative: Link to External Code Refs
If you have large or many A2s:

Upload code as separate .py, .js, .cs files

In Airtable A2 field, just store the path or filename, like:
code/trade_logic.py

You can then:

Load or reference them from Notion, GitHub, or a backend file handler

Use the AX layer to actually convert them when needed

Bonus Tip:
To test:
Paste a triple-quoted block into Google Sheets → Export as CSV → Re-open in a UTF-8-aware editor (like VS Code or Sublime).
If the code block stays intact, you’re safe.

Want me to generate a multi-row A2 CSV test file with a few large code blocks so you can trial it directly?

You said:
So is it possible that I could use Makersuite, or Custom GPT, or Google Colab that'll be able to take our A1, A2, A3 from working here? I can run it through that code, and it'll parse it out correctly in the type of CSV I need to upload.
ChatGPT said:
Yes—it’s absolutely possible, and actually very smart. You can build a simple pipeline using Colab or a Custom GPT (even via the API) to process your working modules (A1, A2, A3, AX) and output a clean, Airtable-safe CSV.

Let’s walk through what each tool would do best:

✅ Google Colab (Best for Structured Batches)
You can:

Paste or upload A1, A2, A3 content into Colab (as text or file)

Use Python (like we did earlier) to:

Escape problematic characters

Wrap A2 in triple quotes

Format as CSV with clean headers

Output a downloadable CSV ready for Airtable

This is your best choice for batch uploading and testing.

✅ Custom GPT (Best for Semi-Automated Parsing)
You could train it to:

Accept A1, A2, A3 blocks in Markdown or pasted form

Ask clarifying questions like “Is this for UI or CNS?”

Output rows with clean CSV formatting or even Airtable-ready JSON

It’s great for interactive cleanup or parsing help, but not ideal for multi-row exports with code unless connected to a backend or plugin.

✅ MakerSuite (Google AI Studio)
You could prototype this in MakerSuite, but:

It doesn’t support multi-file or heavy code input well

CSV output formatting might not be consistent or editable

It’s better for natural language logic—not structured exports

✅ Ideal Setup (if you want to scale)
Designate a folder (GDrive, GitHub, or local) where A1–A3 are saved per component

Use Colab to read those files

Write a Colab script that:

Reads each .md, .py, .json

Structures the CSV rows cleanly

Escapes newlines and wraps A2

Exports the final CSV directly to Airtable or local download

I can generate that full Colab notebook for you right now if you want. You’d just drop your files into a folder, run the script, and boom—Airtable-ready CSV with perfect formatting. Want me to prep it?

You said:
The goal would be to process multiple units or modules the way we've been using them through this pipeline, and then they all append to a sheet. And on that sheet, that's what we use to upload to Airtable and populate the different cards. Now, that means that the triple double quotes thing that you said, that logic has to be embedded in the logic of whichever is parsing it, whether it be Makersuite or Colab or Custom GPT. Now, if that's correct, I understand it. The issue then becomes, once I run one, two, three, four, six modules in there and get it all converted to block CSVs, how do those go and upload to Airtable? When they upload to Airtable, they make their own individual card. Is that what happens?
ChatGPT said:
Yes—you’ve got it exactly right. Let me break it down in real terms with your workflow:

✅ Your Pipeline: End-to-End Flow
1. INPUT FORMAT:
Your modules use A1, A2, A3, AX (+ Notes, Department, Component)

2. CONVERSION TOOL:
Use Colab or Custom GPT to:

Parse each unit

Format A2 with """ for line-break safety

Add each processed unit to a running CSV sheet

Output final CSV for Airtable import

3. CSV UPLOAD TO AIRTABLE:

When you import that CSV into Airtable and do field mapping, Airtable:

Reads each row as one record (a "card" in your view)

Maps each column (A1, A2, etc.) to your pre-existing fields

Auto-creates those records in your target table

So yes—each row becomes its own individual card, assuming you map the columns correctly.

✅ What You Need to Ensure That Works Smoothly
Airtable Field Setup:

Create a table where fields = your columns: Department, Component, A1, A2, A3, AX, Notes

Set A2 and AX fields as Long Text (and allow rich text or markdown)

Upload Settings:

Choose “Custom Field Mapping” when importing the CSV

Review that A2 maps to your Long Text field

Import → it’ll append one new record per row

✅ BONUS: If You Want to Keep Updating Later
To avoid duplicates when re-uploading:

Add a unique key (like Component or Module ID)

Use Airtable’s “Update by matching field” import mode

That way you can append or replace rows cleanly

Would you like me to now build you the Colab notebook that:

Takes a folder of A1/A2/A3/AX files

Converts them to a CSV with triple-quoted A2 blocks

Appends each row to a growing sheet

Lets you download that sheet for Airtable upload?

Just say “build the notebook” and I’ll generate it now.

You said:
That'll be great, but first you have to make a A1, A2, A3, whatever, you have to make a template that we use here. So when I ask you, all right, we're done with this, let me get it in A1, A2, A3, you know, uploadable format, then it has to follow the same format, because that format is what Colab will be looking for to convert it correctly.
ChatGPT said:
Perfect. Let's lock in the canonical A1–A2–A3–AX uploadable format that will serve as the single source of truth for everything we pass through Colab, Custom GPTs, or MakerSuite.

✅ OFFICIAL MODULE TEMPLATE FORMAT (FOR UPLOAD & COLAB PARSING)
Each unit—whether it’s a module, department, or component—must be formatted exactly like this, and we will treat this format as universal going forward:

markdown
Copy
Edit
---
Department: [Name of the Department]  
Component: [Name of the Component]  
Module ID: [Optional unique key, if used]
---

### A1 – Documentation
[Full narrative and functional doc: purpose, dependencies, integration, etc.]

### A2 – Code Logic
```python
# Code block starts here
def example():
    return "This is valid Python"
A3 – Supplement or Mediator
[file_reference.json, chart.yaml, layout.svg]

AX – Unity Translator Output
sjson
Copy
Edit
{ "export": "unity_formatted_payload", "target": "ScriptableObject" }
Notes
[Human-readable notes, TODOs, special instructions, metadata]

yaml
Copy
Edit

---

## KEY RULES FOR THIS FORMAT

- **Triple backticks** must be used around code blocks (for A2 and AX)  
- A2 code block must be **Python-formatted**, even if it will later be converted  
- If there's no AX yet, leave the section blank but still include the header  
- File references in A3 must be comma-separated, not bulleted  
- “Department” and “Component” must be above the A1 section and parsed as metadata  
- This structure must stay consistent or the Colab parser will reject it

---

Would you like me to show you an example right now using this format?  
And then I’ll build the Colab parser to match it exactly.

ChatGPT said:
Thanks for the screenshots—this confirms your Notion/Airtable schema structure visually. Here’s how we lock your format into a single source-of-truth template that both you and Colab can use going forward.

✅ OFFICIAL A1/A2/A3/AX TEMPLATE FOR YOUR SYSTEM
CSV/Colab-Compatible Structure

Field Definitions:
Field Name	Description
Module ID	Unique identifier per build (001, 002, etc.)
Status	incomplete / complete / validated
Department	One of: CNS, Router, Turn Engine, Redington, UI
Component	Name of the unit (voice_engine, war_lattice, etc.)
Tags	Pipe-delimited: `statecraft
Subgroup	Optional functional categorization (logic-core, UI-render, etc.)
A1	Documentation (multi-line OK, wrapped in """)
A2	Code block (must use """ + \n for line breaks)
A3	Schema files, visual references (comma-separated, no bullets)
AX	Unity-ready export (SJSON or ScriptableObject map, in """)
Notes	Developer notes (optional)

✅ COLAB PARSER EXPECTATIONS
A2 and AX are triple-quoted, escaped-safe

Tags must be | delimited for clean split

CSV must be UTF-8 encoded

Each row = one Airtable card

Would you like me to:

Generate an example CSV using this format (with a few rows prefilled)?

Build the Colab uploader/parser that processes Markdown or raw content into this structure?

Just say the word: “build CSV” or “build Colab.”

You said:
You forgot dependencies.  Even though it's in a1.  Specifically create a spot for at least the component it's dependent on. 
ChatGPT said:
Perfect call. Dependencies deserve their own dedicated field, even if they're already mentioned in A1. This gives you:

Structured parsing

Filter logic

Automated linking later

✅ UPDATED FIELD STRUCTURE (with Dependencies)
Here's the new layout:

New Column: Dependencies
Format: Pipe-delimited (|)

Example: CNS|Router|Turn Engine

Optional—but recommended for all core components

✅ Final Field Reference Table
Field Name	Description
Module ID	Unique numeric or string identifier
Status	Completion state (incomplete, validated, etc.)
Department	Which system this belongs to (CNS, Router, etc.)
Component	Component name (voice_engine, summary_screen, etc.)
Tags	Categories (e.g., SPY, simulation-core) separated by `
Subgroup	Sub-function label (e.g., REDDINGTON, logic-core)
Dependencies	Required component(s) like Turn Engine, Router, etc.
A1	Full documentation block (wrapped in triple quotes)
A2	Code block (use """ + escaped line breaks)
A3	Visuals, schemas, or files (comma-separated)
AX	Unity-ready output (SJSON or asset map)
Notes	Freeform developer notes

Let me know when you're ready and I’ll:

Build the starter CSV file with this structure

Or generate the Colab processor that reads this as the parsing schema

Just say “build CSV” or “build Colab with dependencies.”

You said:
Now you can create the working template that we used to make sure that all of those fields are attached when we give it to Google Colab. So Colab can build the parsing engine with those dependencies in it. So yeah, build them both.
