# POLICY :: ThreadJuice Module Archive

This repository contains the working system files, module outlines, diagrams, metadata, and notes for the POLICY simulation engine. All data originates from structured ThreadJuice sessions and narrative state builds focused on governance modeling, regional mechanics, and assistant-driven cognition.

## Structure Overview

- `/modules` — Contains functional game engine modules (Statecraft, Resource Engine, Ledger, etc.)
- `/diagrams` — Flowcharts, knowledge graphs, cube face architecture sketches
- `/notes` — Strategy memos, assistant ideation logs, voice-mode conceptual threads
- `/playbooks` — Narrative scripts and event sequences
- `/csv_data` — Dataframes used in simulation logic and module analysis

## Jules Action Plan

Jules, here's what we need from you:

- [ ] Analyze each folder and flag any **incomplete modules** or broken linkages
- [ ] Refactor poorly formatted or disorganized code where possible
- [ ] Annotate stubs and unfinished sections with TODOs
- [ ] Clean and align all module filenames to match ThreadJuice index
- [ ] Generate a `module_map.md` based on file contents
- [ ] Recommend missing documentation or setup scaffolds
- [ ] Begin lightweight test coverage where function logic is obvious
- [ ] Flag files where assistant memory (context) needs to be re-injected

## Context Reference

This project is actively evolving toward full cognition-integrated simulation architecture. Do not delete partials, assistant logs, or voice-parsed markdown—they serve as context layers.

When in doubt, **preserve the structure**, **mark gaps**, and prepare the surface for human refinement.

### ThreadJuice Intent: Preserve, Scaffold, Evolve.
