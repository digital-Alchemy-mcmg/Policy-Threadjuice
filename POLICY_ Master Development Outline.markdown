I. INTRODUCTION: THE GAME DEVELOPMENT JOURNEY
──────────────────────────────────────────────
A. Overview of the Game Development Lifecycle as a Structured Process
Creating a video game like POLICY, a 2D Turn-Based Strategy/Simulation, is a complex blend of artistic creativity and technical execution. This lifecycle—spanning Conception & Pre-Production, Production, Testing & Quality Assurance, and Launch & Post-Launch—ensures efficiency and manages the complexity of crafting an engaging player experience in a post-collapse United States setting.

*Note: Some details may be subject to change. Please refer to the latest versioning for the best source of information.*

F. Technical Planning
- Game Engine: Unity 6000.0.47 for 2D turn-based logic.
- Production Pipeline: Asset integration via Kumu Export, version control with Git.
- Tools: Blender (art), Audacity (audio), Jira (management).
- Technical Risk: Performance with large Kumo datasets, mitigated by early optimization.

F.1. System Architecture and Communication
- Core Conceptual Framework:
  → Decoupling: Separate game systems (AI, physics, rendering, inventory, combat, UI) into independent Modules.
  → Dedicated Handlers: Mediator prepares output from one Module for the next.
  → Standardized Transport: Consistent data format (JSON schemas mapped to C# objects) for in-memory communication.
  → Instruction-Based Routing: Manifest instructs the Router on data routing and formatting.
  → Workflow Management: Define system sequences externally via Unity-compatible formats.
- Deployment: Single Unity build; components are logical units within the codebase, compiled into one executable.
- Communication Mechanisms:
  → Shoots: Direct method calls for deterministic, low-latency handoffs to CNS; supplemented by a local event bus (UniRx or custom system) for real-time notifications (e.g., "Turn Completed", "Error Raised").
  → CNS (Conveyor Belt): In-memory message queue or event bus; CNS and Router listen on shared UniRx Subjects for routed packets.
  → Mediator ↔ Router: Manifests passed as in-memory objects via direct method calls or shared channels.
- Language: Primarily C# within Unity environment; JSON schemas define internal data structures.
- Performance Bottlenecks: Focus on CPU performance, memory allocation, and garbage collection, managed with Unity coroutines and a custom turn-step scheduler.
- Workflow Configuration: JSON as primary format (compatible with Google Colab + Kumo, runtime loading ease); ScriptableObjects for static configuration snapshots (e.g., governance profiles, kit recipes).
- Optimization: Use C# Jobs for batch operations (e.g., score evaluations), Burst Compiler for inner-loop resource math, and object pooling for memory reuse.

F.2. Module Repository in Airtable
- Repository Structure: Airtable base named "POLICY Module Repository" with a "Live module development table" containing:
  → Modules Table: Records for each module (e.g., LedgerModule_X, ResourcesModule_0) with fields:
    - mod info: Module name (e.g., "LedgerModule_X").
    - Status: Development stage (e.g., "Pending Review", "incomplete").
    - Tags: Categories (e.g., "simulation-core", "war", "SPY").
    - Purpose: Detailed description of functionality, attributes tracked, and dependencies (e.g., "LedgerModule_X serves as the central attribute reconciliation system").
    - Implementation: Pseudocode or C# snippet outlining logic (e.g., Ledger class with update method).
    - Data Schema: JSON schema for inputs, outputs, and dependencies (e.g., inputs: attribute_key, delta).
    - Additional Fields: Subgroup for organization, hidden fields for version control or team assignments.
- Module Transformation:
  → From GDD: Conceptual descriptions are transformed into structured Airtable fields.
  → From Prototype: Functional specs (e.g., JSON schemas, performance data) are uploaded as field entries or attachments.
  → Standardization: Data adheres to JSON schemas for consistency with in-memory communication.
- Collaboration: Airtable enables team-wide access, with fields like Status and Tags facilitating development tracking and categorization.
