When I'm about to introduce to you is the end of the floating region names and policy. The states have a home now for good. This is the gold standard for the regions. I am also introducing the production modifier. Finishing the migration logic. How spies, advocates, travel. How production chain and trading works. Trade travels. And I'm going to give you each regions starting. Resource advantages.

Understood. This locks in a critical milestone.

Please proceed by providing:

Final Region Map – List of each region name and its included states (fixed, canonical).

Production Modifiers – Base formula or rules used to calculate production efficiency per region.

Migration Logic – Finalized travel logic (duration, triggers, pull/push weighting, etc.).

Agent Systems – How spies, advocates, and other actors move, operate, and are tracked across regions.

Trade Logic – Explicit rules for commodity movement, inter-region transfer times, blockades, or friction.

Regional Starting Advantages – Resource bonuses or multipliers per region at game start.

Once you send that, I’ll begin translating it into modular-ready data for systems integration. If you prefer to deliver it step-by-step or by subsystem (e.g., migration first), just say so.

Okay, I have reviewed the entire thread you provided. Here is a comprehensive document that distills the information, explains the mechanisms and functions, ties the logic together, and includes examples and documentation for your POLICY Simulation Engine.

## POLICY Simulation Engine: System Documentation

This document outlines the structure, components, and mechanics of the POLICY Simulation Engine, a sophisticated system designed for strategic simulations, economic modeling, and policy planning.

**I. System Overview**

The POLICY Simulation Engine models a complex socio-economic and political landscape divided into distinct regions. It incorporates dynamic resource production, trade, population movement, military/intelligence operations, and economic events like labor strikes. The engine operates on a turn-based system where actions and movements progress incrementally.

**II. Core Components**

The simulation is built upon several interconnected core components:

**A. Regions (10)**
The game world consists of 10 distinct regions, each with the following attributes:

  * **Constituent U.S. States:** A list of U.S. states that form the region.
  * **Population Estimate:** The total population of the region (in millions).
  * **Three Capital Cities:**
      * **Main Capital:** Political and administrative center.
      * **Military Capital:** Defense, intelligence, and logistics hub.
      * **Trade Capital:** Economic and commerce center.
  * **Regional GDP:** The gross domestic product of the region (in trillions of USD).
  * **Production Drive Modifier:** An economic performance indicator affecting resource output.
  * **Resource Profile:**
      * **Most Abundant Resource(s):** Resources naturally plentiful in the region.
      * **Most Scarce Resource(s):** Resources that are limited or typically imported.
      * **Most Profitable Resource:** High-value resource driving the internal economy.
      * **Most Profitable Trade Commodity:** Exported commodity with the highest economic return.

**B. Production Drive Modifier**
This modifier dynamically adjusts a region's production rate for its most abundant resources and trade commodities.

  * **Mechanism:** A simple multiplier system.
  * **Tiers & Effect on Production:**
      * **+1:** 1.5x normal rate (Fast draw, fast refill)
      * **+0.5:** 1.25x normal rate (Balanced)
      * **0:** 1.0x normal rate (Neutral)
      * **-0.5:** 0.75x normal rate (Slower output, slower refill)
      * **-1:** 0.5x normal rate (Very slow output, but stable long-term supply for abundant resources)
  * **Example:** If base production is 50 units/turn:
      * With +1 modifier: 50 \* 1.5 = 75 units
      * With -1 modifier: 50 \* 0.5 = 25 units

**C. State-Level and Regional Resources**

  * **State-Level Attributes:** Each state within a region has its own profile detailing its Most Abundant Resource, Most Profitable Trade Commodity, Most Profitable Resource, and Most Scarce Resource.
  * **Regional Aggregation:** This data is aggregated at the regional level to provide a broader economic overview.
  * **Tracking:** Resources are tracked at both state and regional levels, allowing for detailed economic management.
  * **Interaction with Modifier:** The region's Production Drive Modifier applies to the state's production of its key commodities.
  * **Replenishment:**
      * **Abundant Resources:** Always available; production rate is affected by the modifier, but the resource itself doesn't deplete easily (replenishment often keeps pace, especially if production is slow).
      * **Scarce Resources:** Limited supply; may require imports or investment. Depletion is a factor.
      * **Profitable Resources/Commodities:** Drive economic growth and trade.

**D. The Three-Capital System (Strategic Nodes)**
Each region's three capitals serve as strategic nodes for various actions and movements within the turn-based engine. This allows for separation of concerns and manages different types of routes and activities.

  * **Main Capital (Political/Administrative/Governance Hub):**
      * **Function:** Center for governance, lawmaking, policy decisions, diplomacy, and high-level decision-making. Labor relations may also be managed from here.
      * **Movement:** Used for diplomatic exchanges and as a start/end point for high-level policy actions. Population migration can pass through or start/end here.
  * **Military Capital (Defense/Operations/Intelligence Hub):**
      * **Function:** Strategic military base for defense coordination, intelligence operations, and military movement.
      * **Movement:** Required start and end point for spy operations and military deployments. Population migration can pass through.
  * **Trade Capital (Economic/Logistics/Production Exchange Hub):**
      * **Function:** Major economic center for production, commerce, trade, resource distribution, and supply chain management. Labor relations and negotiations for out-of-region activities are managed here.
      * **Movement:** Required start and end point for trade routes and resource distribution. Population migration can pass through.

**III. System Mechanics and Logic**

**A. Resource Production and Replenishment**

  * **Base Production:** Actual Output = Base Rate * (1 + Production Drive Modifier Effect)
      * Example: Modifier +1 (1.5x effect which is 1 + 0.5), Modifier -1 (0.5x effect which is 1 - 0.5). The table implies:
          * \+1: Base \* 1.5
          * \+0.5: Base \* 1.25
          * 0: Base \* 1.0
          * \-0.5: Base \* 0.75
          * \-1: Base \* 0.5
  * **Abundant Resources:** Production rate is modified, but these resources are generally stable and replenish. Slower production (due to negative modifiers) can mean that natural replenishment easily keeps up, ensuring continuous abundance.
  * **Scarce Resources:** Production is modified, but these are finite and can be depleted. They may necessitate imports or strategic investments.

**B. Movement and Logistics (Turn-Based)**

  * **General Rule:** Each move between capital nodes (inter- or intra-region) typically takes **1 turn (e.g., 1 week)**.

  * **Path Selection:** Players/AI can choose the path with the **least number of moves** to reach the destination. However, all start and end node type requirements for the specific action must be met.

  * **Node Traversal:** Units *can pass through any valid capital node type* en route to their destination, provided their specific action's start and end node requirements are met.

  * **Movement Rules by Action Type:**

    | Movement Type        | Must Start At Node Type | Must End At Node Type | Can Pass Through Node Types |
    | :------------------- | :-------------------- | :------------------ | :-------------------------- |
    | **Spy Operations** | Military Capital      | Military Capital    | Any                         |
    | **Trade Movement** | Trade Capital         | Trade Capital       | Any                         |
    | **Diplomatic Travel**| Main Capital          | Main Capital        | Any                         |
    | **Population Migration**| Any Capital           | Any Capital         | Any (shortest path chosen)  |
    | **Advocates (Labor Relations)** | Main Capital (State Capital) | Trade Capital | Any |

**C. Labor Strikes and Disruptions**

  * **Impact:** Labor strikes or other disruptions in a region cause delays.
  * **Delay Quantum:** Each strike typically adds **+1 week (1 turn)** of delay for movement or resource transport that needs to pass through the affected region or node.
  * **Cascading Effects:** Delays can affect trade routes, migration paths, labor flow, and diplomatic exchanges, potentially leading to supply chain bottlenecks, inflation, or diplomatic tension.

**IV. Integrated Regional Data**

The following table consolidates all key information for each of the 10 regions:

| Region Name                 | States Included                              | Population (M) | Main Capital      | Military Capital      | Trade Capital       | Production Drive Modifier | Most Abundant Resource(s)           | Most Scarce Resource(s) | Most Profitable Resource   | Most Profitable Trade Commodity |

*Note: The "Node Role Mapping" column from the thread (e.g., "Main / Military / Trade") is implicitly covered by listing the three distinct capitals.*

**V. Example Scenarios**

These examples illustrate the application of movement and event mechanics:

**A. Spy Deployment: Pacific Confederation to Keystone States**

  * **Objective:** Deploy a spy.
  * **Start Requirement:** Military Capital in Pacific Confederation (e.g., Beale AFB, CA).
  * **End Requirement:** Military Capital in Keystone States (e.g., West Chester, PA).
  * **Path Logic:** Can travel through any capital type. The player/AI chooses the shortest path (least moves) meeting start/end requirements.
      * Example Path: Beale AFB, CA (Military) -\> [Intermediate Node(s), e.g., Minot AFB, ND (Military)] -\> West Chester, PA (Military). If this path is 3 moves, it takes 3 weeks.
  * **Original Thread Example Path (illustrative of multi-hop, not necessarily optimal or strictly adhering to final rules for pathing *through*):**
      * Start: Los Angeles, CA (Trade Capital) - *Initial thread error, should start Military* -\> Beale AFB, CA (Military) -\> Seattle, WA (Trade) -\> Minot AFB, ND (Military) -\> West Chester, PA (Military) -\> End: Philadelphia, PA (Main Capital) - *Initial thread error, should end Military*.
      * **Corrected based on final rules:** Spy starts at Beale AFB, CA (Military) and must end at West Chester, PA (Military). The path can include Trade or Main capitals in between if it makes the route shorter.

**B. Population Migration: Coastal Confederate to Northern Frontier**

  * **Objective:** Migrate population.
  * **Start Requirement:** Any Capital in Coastal Confederate (e.g., Savannah, GA - Trade).
  * **End Requirement:** Any Capital in Northern Frontier (e.g., Minneapolis, MN - Main).
  * **Path Logic:** Any capital types can be used along the shortest path.
      * Example Path (shortest path): Savannah, GA (Trade) -\> [e.g., New Orleans (Trade) -\> Denver (Trade) -\> Seattle (Trade)] -\> Minneapolis, MN (Main). If this path is 4 moves, it takes 4 weeks.

**C. Labor Stoppage Chain & Trade Disruption**

  * **Scenario:**
      * Strike in Texas (Sierra Mesa region).
      * Strike in Dixieland region.
      * Trade route: Sierra Mesa -\> Dixieland -\> Independence Union.
  * **Impact:**
      * Movement through Sierra Mesa: +1 week delay.
      * Movement through Dixieland: +1 week delay.
  * **Total Delay for Trade Route:** If a trade shipment from Sierra Mesa to Independence Union normally takes 4 weeks (4 moves) and must pass through nodes affected by both strikes, the total travel time becomes 4 + 2 = 6 weeks.
  * **Consequences:** Supply chain bottlenecks, potential inflation in Independence Union, and diplomatic strain.

**VI. Data Structure for Game Engine Integration**

FUNCTION validate_movement_start_end(action_type, start_node_actual_type, end_node_actual_type):
  // Validate that the chosen start and end nodes are of the correct type for the action

  IF action_type == 'spy_operations':
    RETURN (start_node_actual_type == 'MilitaryCapital' AND end_node_actual_type == 'MilitaryCapital')
  ELSE IF action_type == 'trade_movement':
    RETURN (start_node_actual_type == 'TradeCapital' AND end_node_actual_type == 'TradeCapital')
  ELSE IF action_type == 'diplomatic_travel':
    RETURN (start_node_actual_type == 'MainCapital' AND end_node_actual_type == 'MainCapital')
  ELSE IF action_type == 'population_migration':
    RETURN TRUE // Any capital type is valid for start and end
  ELSE IF action_type == 'advocates':
    RETURN (start_node_actual_type == 'MainCapital' AND end_node_actual_type == 'TradeCapital')
  ELSE:
    RETURN FALSE // Unknown action type
  END IF
END FUNCTION

// Pathfinding logic would then find the shortest path between the validated start/end nodes,
// allowing traversal through any intermediate capital node types.

You said:
Just so we're on the same page, I want you to explain back to me what is the reason we have three capitals. I want you to explain the furthest move of any two objects on the game as far as turns that it would take to get from A to B. Explain which region has the highest population, which region has the best GDP per capita, and if there are any regions who are out of balance with the others.
ChatGPT said:
Absolutely. Here's a full confirmation of your logic and structure, answering each question point-by-point:

✅ Why Do We Have Three Capitals Per Region?
The Three-Capital System divides strategic operations into distinct node types within each region:

Capital Type	Role & Purpose
Main Capital	Political and administrative center. Used for diplomatic travel, high-level governance, population migration start/end.
Military Capital	Defense, intelligence, and logistics hub. Required for spy operations, military deployments, and some migration paths.
Trade Capital	Economic and commerce center. Controls trade movements, resource distribution, labor management, and outbound economic activity.

Reasoning: This structure enforces differentiated functionality and forces the player (or AI) to strategize movement type, starting location, and path selection, adding realism and depth to logistical planning. It prevents “do everything from one city” scenarios and maps real-world analogues of power decentralization.

✅ What’s the Furthest Possible Move in the Game (in Turns)?
Movement Rule Recap:

Every move from one capital node to another (inter- or intra-region) takes 1 turn (1 week).

Movements can traverse any capital type, but must start and end at the correct node types based on the action.

🔍 Example: Maximum-Distance Move
Let’s compute a worst-case spy operation:

Start: Beale AFB, CA (Pacific Confederation — Military Capital)

End: Minot AFB, ND → West Chester, PA (Northern Frontier → Keystone States — Military Capital)

Using a plausible non-looping but geographically long path like:

Beale AFB (Pacific)

Seattle (Pacific)

Denver (Heartland)

Little Rock AFB (Dixieland)

Tyndall AFB (Coastal Confederate)

Charlotte (Commonwealth)

Kingdom City (Commonwealth Military Node)

Minot AFB (Northern Frontier)

West Chester, PA (Keystone)

That’s ~8–9 hops, or 8–9 turns total, though this could be reduced depending on optimal routing.

🔢 Theoretical Maximum:
~10 turns is the upper bound for any full-region-crossing movement, assuming strikes, delays, or forced detours. That’s the highest time cost a spy or resource convoy might realistically face.

✅ Which Region Has the Highest Population?
From your final region table:

Region	Population (M)
Great Lakes Federation	47.0M ✅
Pacific Confederation	46.3M
Coastal Confederate	41.3M
Sierra Mesa	43.3M

🔹 Conclusion:
Great Lakes Federation has the highest total population at ~47.0 million.

✅ Which Region Has the Best GDP per Capita?
While exact GDP values were not given, we can approximate GDP per capita using production drive and resource types as proxies.

We will calculate a proxy score:

High-value industries: Tech/IP, Biotech, Automobiles, Pharmaceuticals.

Modifier weight: +1 (1.5x) suggests higher output per capita.

Let’s consider:

Region	Population	Profitable Industry	Modifier	Notes
Pacific Confederation	46.3M	Tech/IP	+1	High-value exports, large modifier
Great Lakes Federation	47.0M	Automobiles	+1	Large pop dilutes per capita slightly
Sierra Mesa	43.3M	Oil (stable but finite)	+1	High GDP but not per capita leading
Independence Union	35.1M	Biotech, Aerospace Components	–0.5	High value, but lower output modifier

🔹 Conclusion (GDP/Capita Proxy Leader):
Pacific Confederation likely has the best GDP per capita, due to:

High-value industries (Tech/IP)

A +1 modifier

Large, but not top-heavy population (46.3M)

✅ Are Any Regions Out of Balance?
Yes — a few imbalances or asymmetries stand out:

1. The Heartland
Lowest modifier (-1)

Scarce water

Lowest population (18.4M)

Profitable commodity is Corn (low value)

🔻 This region is clearly resource poor, economically weak, and vulnerable to drought, strikes, and supply chain disruptions.

2. Northern Frontier
Also has a –0.5 modifier

Scarce water, but has rare resources like semiconductors, copper, silver

🔸 A “tech frontier” but crippled by scarcity and low production rate — could act as a swing region if invested in, but high fragility

3. Dixieland
–0.5 modifier, low population (21.8M), low-value exports like poultry

Resource-rich but export-poor, and with poor per capita output

✅ Summary
Metric	Region	Value
Most Populous	Great Lakes Federation	~47.0M
Best GDP per Capita (proxy)	Pacific Confederation	Tech/IP, +1 modifier
Weakest (imbalanced)	The Heartland	–1 modifier, Corn economy
Furthest Action Path	Spy Ops (e.g. CA to PA)	~8–10 turns (worst case)
Three Capital Rationale	Node control, action stratification, realism	

Let me know if you'd like a heatmap, scorecard, or risk tier list for these regions next.

Status: Validated  
Subgroup: REGIONS  
Tags: region-logic, resource-modeling, turn-engine  
Module Number: 1  
🧾 A1 – MODULE DOCUMENTATION
Module Name: RegionProfileModule_1
Purpose:
Defines a canonical region in the POLICY Simulation Engine, capturing its identity, population, capital node locations, production traits, and resource-economic profile. Used to structure game logic around turn-based actions, economic balancing, and strategic movement.

Key Elements:
Element	Description
Region Identity	Includes region name and U.S. state composition
Population Estimate	In millions; used for migration, labor force, and GDP/capita calculations
Capital Nodes	Main (governance), Military (spy/military ops), Trade (logistics/economy)
Production Modifier	Affects output rate of abundant/strategic resources (–1 to +1 range)
Resource Types	Tracked at both state and regional level
Economic Role	Profit resources and commodities drive exports and internal revenue

Resource Behavior Rules:
Resource Type	Behavior in Turn Engine
Abundant	Always available; high replenishment. Production slows under strain but is resilient.
Scarce	Limited supply. May deplete. Requires imports or heavy investment.
Profitable	Drives trade, GDP, and resource investment. Typically highest value for the region.
Trade Commodity	Primary export; key driver of international relationships and faction leverage.

Integration Points:
MigrationManager and TradeRouteEngine reference region population and capitals for travel logic.

LedgerModule pulls from production modifier and profitable outputs to calculate per-turn gains.

Assistant Reports draw narrative commentary from region traits (scarcity, profit risk, trade bottlenecks).

You said:
Okay, I have reviewed the entire thread you provided. Here is a comprehensive document that distills the information, explains the mechanisms and functions, ties the logic together, and includes examples and documentation for your POLICY Simulation Engine.

## POLICY Simulation Engine: System Documentation

This document outlines the structure, components, and mechanics of the POLICY Simulation Engine, a sophisticated system designed for strategic simulations, economic modeling, and policy planning.

**I. System Overview**

The POLICY Simulation Engine models a complex socio-economic and political landscape divided into distinct regions. It incorporates dynamic resource production, trade, population movement, military/intelligence operations, and economic events like labor strikes. The engine operates on a turn-based system where actions and movements progress incrementally.

**II. Core Components**

The simulation is built upon several interconnected core components:

**A. Regions (10)**
The game world consists of 10 distinct regions, each with the following attributes:

  * **Constituent U.S. States:** A list of U.S. states that form the region.
  * **Population Estimate:** The total population of the region (in millions).
  * **Three Capital Cities:**
      * **Main Capital:** Political and administrative center.
      * **Military Capital:** Defense, intelligence, and logistics hub.
      * **Trade Capital:** Economic and commerce center.
  * **Regional GDP:** The gross domestic product of the region (in trillions of USD).
  * **Production Drive Modifier:** An economic performance indicator affecting resource output.
  * **Resource Profile:**
      * **Most Abundant Resource(s):** Resources naturally plentiful in the region.
      * **Most Scarce Resource(s):** Resources that are limited or typically imported.
      * **Most Profitable Resource:** High-value resource driving the internal economy.
      * **Most Profitable Trade Commodity:** Exported commodity with the highest economic return.

**B. Production Drive Modifier**
This modifier dynamically adjusts a region's production rate for its most abundant resources and trade commodities.

  * **Mechanism:** A simple multiplier system.
  * **Tiers & Effect on Production:**
      * **+1:** 1.5x normal rate (Fast draw, fast refill)
      * **+0.5:** 1.25x normal rate (Balanced)
      * **0:** 1.0x normal rate (Neutral)
      * **-0.5:** 0.75x normal rate (Slower output, slower refill)
      * **-1:** 0.5x normal rate (Very slow output, but stable long-term supply for abundant resources)
  * **Example:** If base production is 50 units/turn:
      * With +1 modifier: 50 \* 1.5 = 75 units
      * With -1 modifier: 50 \* 0.5 = 25 units

**C. State-Level and Regional Resources**

  * **State-Level Attributes:** Each state within a region has its own profile detailing its Most Abundant Resource, Most Profitable Trade Commodity, Most Profitable Resource, and Most Scarce Resource.
  * **Regional Aggregation:** This data is aggregated at the regional level to provide a broader economic overview.
  * **Tracking:** Resources are tracked at both state and regional levels, allowing for detailed economic management.
  * **Interaction with Modifier:** The region's Production Drive Modifier applies to the state's production of its key commodities.
  * **Replenishment:**
      * **Abundant Resources:** Always available; production rate is affected by the modifier, but the resource itself doesn't deplete easily (replenishment often keeps pace, especially if production is slow).
      * **Scarce Resources:** Limited supply; may require imports or investment. Depletion is a factor.
      * **Profitable Resources/Commodities:** Drive economic growth and trade.

**D. The Three-Capital System (Strategic Nodes)**
Each region's three capitals serve as strategic nodes for various actions and movements within the turn-based engine. This allows for separation of concerns and manages different types of routes and activities.

  * **Main Capital (Political/Administrative/Governance Hub):**
      * **Function:** Center for governance, lawmaking, policy decisions, diplomacy, and high-level decision-making. Labor relations may also be managed from here.
      * **Movement:** Used for diplomatic exchanges and as a start/end point for high-level policy actions. Population migration can pass through or start/end here.
  * **Military Capital (Defense/Operations/Intelligence Hub):**
      * **Function:** Strategic military base for defense coordination, intelligence operations, and military movement.
      * **Movement:** Required start and end point for spy operations and military deployments. Population migration can pass through.
  * **Trade Capital (Economic/Logistics/Production Exchange Hub):**
      * **Function:** Major economic center for production, commerce, trade, resource distribution, and supply chain management. Labor relations and negotiations for out-of-region activities are managed here.
      * **Movement:** Required start and end point for trade routes and resource distribution. Population migration can pass through.

**III. System Mechanics and Logic**

**A. Resource Production and Replenishment**

  * **Base Production:** Actual Output = Base Rate * (1 + Production Drive Modifier Effect)
      * Example: Modifier +1 (1.5x effect which is 1 + 0.5), Modifier -1 (0.5x effect which is 1 - 0.5). The table implies:
          * \+1: Base \* 1.5
          * \+0.5: Base \* 1.25
          * 0: Base \* 1.0
          * \-0.5: Base \* 0.75
          * \-1: Base \* 0.5
  * **Abundant Resources:** Production rate is modified, but these resources are generally stable and replenish. Slower production (due to negative modifiers) can mean that natural replenishment easily keeps up, ensuring continuous abundance.
  * **Scarce Resources:** Production is modified, but these are finite and can be depleted. They may necessitate imports or strategic investments.

**B. Movement and Logistics (Turn-Based)**

  * **General Rule:** Each move between capital nodes (inter- or intra-region) typically takes **1 turn (e.g., 1 week)**.

  * **Path Selection:** Players/AI can choose the path with the **least number of moves** to reach the destination. However, all start and end node type requirements for the specific action must be met.

  * **Node Traversal:** Units *can pass through any valid capital node type* en route to their destination, provided their specific action's start and end node requirements are met.

  * **Movement Rules by Action Type:**

    | Movement Type        | Must Start At Node Type | Must End At Node Type | Can Pass Through Node Types |
    | :------------------- | :-------------------- | :------------------ | :-------------------------- |
    | **Spy Operations** | Military Capital      | Military Capital    | Any                         |
    | **Trade Movement** | Trade Capital         | Trade Capital       | Any                         |
    | **Diplomatic Travel**| Main Capital          | Main Capital        | Any                         |
    | **Population Migration**| Any Capital           | Any Capital         | Any (shortest path chosen)  |
    | **Advocates (Labor Relations)** | Main Capital (State Capital) | Trade Capital | Any |

**C. Labor Strikes and Disruptions**

  * **Impact:** Labor strikes or other disruptions in a region cause delays.
  * **Delay Quantum:** Each strike typically adds **+1 week (1 turn)** of delay for movement or resource transport that needs to pass through the affected region or node.
  * **Cascading Effects:** Delays can affect trade routes, migration paths, labor flow, and diplomatic exchanges, potentially leading to supply chain bottlenecks, inflation, or diplomatic tension.

**IV. Integrated Regional Data**

**V. Example Scenarios**

These examples illustrate the application of movement and event mechanics:

**A. Spy Deployment: Pacific Confederation to Keystone States**

  * **Objective:** Deploy a spy.
  * **Start Requirement:** Military Capital in Pacific Confederation (e.g., Beale AFB, CA).
  * **End Requirement:** Military Capital in Keystone States (e.g., West Chester, PA).
  * **Path Logic:** Can travel through any capital type. The player/AI chooses the shortest path (least moves) meeting start/end requirements.
      * Example Path: Beale AFB, CA (Military) -\> [Intermediate Node(s), e.g., Minot AFB, ND (Military)] -\> West Chester, PA (Military). If this path is 3 moves, it takes 3 weeks.
  * **Original Thread Example Path (illustrative of multi-hop, not necessarily optimal or strictly adhering to final rules for pathing *through*):**
      * Start: Los Angeles, CA (Trade Capital) - *Initial thread error, should start Military* -\> Beale AFB, CA (Military) -\> Seattle, WA (Trade) -\> Minot AFB, ND (Military) -\> West Chester, PA (Military) -\> End: Philadelphia, PA (Main Capital) - *Initial thread error, should end Military*.
      * **Corrected based on final rules:** Spy starts at Beale AFB, CA (Military) and must end at West Chester, PA (Military). The path can include Trade or Main capitals in between if it makes the route shorter.

**B. Population Migration: Coastal Confederate to Northern Frontier**

  * **Objective:** Migrate population.
  * **Start Requirement:** Any Capital in Coastal Confederate (e.g., Savannah, GA - Trade).
  * **End Requirement:** Any Capital in Northern Frontier (e.g., Minneapolis, MN - Main).
  * **Path Logic:** Any capital types can be used along the shortest path.
      * Example Path (shortest path): Savannah, GA (Trade) -\> [e.g., New Orleans (Trade) -\> Denver (Trade) -\> Seattle (Trade)] -\> Minneapolis, MN (Main). If this path is 4 moves, it takes 4 weeks.

**C. Labor Stoppage Chain & Trade Disruption**

  * **Scenario:**
      * Strike in Texas (Sierra Mesa region).
      * Strike in Dixieland region.
      * Trade route: Sierra Mesa -\> Dixieland -\> Independence Union.
  * **Impact:**
      * Movement through Sierra Mesa: +1 week delay.
      * Movement through Dixieland: +1 week delay.
  * **Total Delay for Trade Route:** If a trade shipment from Sierra Mesa to Independence Union normally takes 4 weeks (4 moves) and must pass through nodes affected by both strikes, the total travel time becomes 4 + 2 = 6 weeks.
  * **Consequences:** Supply chain bottlenecks, potential inflation in Independence Union, and diplomatic strain.

🧭 Thread Initialization (MODE : CONTEXT : FOCUS)
MODE: SXV8
CONTEXT: POLICY Simulation
FOCUS: (you define this – e.g., "Region Module Buildout", "Movement Logic", "Productivity Engine")

🧱 Key Reset Questions
What is the exact focus for this fresh start?
(e.g., just redoing modules? starting new mechanic?)

Do you want all 10 regions locked in this new thread?
– Should I assume your latest canonical documentation still applies?

Should I initialize with A1–A2–A3 templates from the start, or wait for CSV/data input?

Once you confirm these, I’ll rebuild the foundation clean and begin again.

Here is Module 2: MovementModule_2 — the complete movement logic engine for the POLICY Simulation, formatted in A1–A2–A3–AX style.

✅ MovementModule_2 – Turn-Based Movement Logic
🧾 A1 – MODULE DOCUMENTATION
Module Name: MovementModule_2
Purpose:
Defines how agents, populations, goods, and political actors move between regions via capital node types. This system enforces start/end validation, turn-based timing, labor disruption penalties, and pathfinding constraints.

🔹 Action Types Modeled:
Action Type	Start Node Type	End Node Type	Traversable Nodes	Notes
Spy Operations	Military Capital	Military Capital	Any	Used for intelligence deployment
Trade Movement	Trade Capital	Trade Capital	Any	Used for commodity transport
Diplomatic Travel	Main Capital	Main Capital	Any	Used for treaties and policy moves
Population Migration	Any Capital	Any Capital	Any	Entirely path-optimized
Advocate Movement	Main Capital	Trade Capital	Any	Used for labor actions

🔹 General Movement Rules:
Each move = 1 turn between capital nodes (inter- or intra-region)

Pathfinding is turn-optimized (shortest path), but constrained by start and end node types

Labor strikes introduce delay modifiers globally or per-node

Capital functions are disjoint — nodes are not interchangeable for initiation/finalization

🔹 Labor Strike Modifier:
+1 turn per affected region (stackable)

A strike in one node applies to all paths passing through that node or region

Used to simulate cascading supply disruptions, unrest, or contested routes

🔹 Example Movement Paths:
Spy from Beale AFB, CA → West Chester, PA (Military → Military)

Path: Beale AFB → Seattle → Minot AFB → West Chester

If 3 regions = 3 turns (+ labor delay if present)

Population Migration from Savannah, GA (Trade) → Minneapolis, MN (Main)

Path: Savannah → New Orleans → Denver → Seattle → Minneapolis

✅ ProductivityModule_3 – Resource ↔ Commodity ↔ Kit Output Mapping
🧾 A1 – MODULE DOCUMENTATION
Module Name: ProductivityModule_3
Purpose:
This module defines how resource types and production modifiers interact with kits to drive economic and strategic output across the simulation. It anchors the resource economy, controls regional kit generation rates, and integrates with Turn Engine balancing.

🔹 Productivity Flow (Core Chain):
pgsql
Copy
Edit
Region Type ➝ Resource Type ➝ Commodity ➝ Kit Output ➝ System Impact
Each kit’s output is governed by:

The resource abundance in the region

The production drive modifier (–1 to +1)

The resource-to-commodity yield map

Whether the commodity is internal or exportable

🔹 Resource Behavior Summary:
Resource Type	Behavior
Abundant	High replenishment; production scales with modifier
Scarce	Finite; drains faster than it replenishes unless mitigated
Profitable	Amplifies regional GDP and internal trade scoring
Trade Commodity	Drives inter-region economy; critical for global influence

🔹 Modifier Effect Table:
Modifier	Output Multiplier	Description
+1.0	×1.5	Strategic epicenter of kit generation
+0.5	×1.25	Regionally strong performer
0	×1.0	Neutral baseline
–0.5	×0.75	Sluggish output, may bottleneck chains
–1.0	×0.5	Fragile economy, replenishment may catch up

🔹 Yield Application:
Base Rule:

        -0.5: 0.75,
        -1.0: 0.5
    }
    multiplier = modifier_map.get(modifier, 1.0)
    return base_yield * multiplier

# Example: Kit yield logic
def generate_kit_output(region, resource_type, base_yield):
    modifier = region["production_drive_modifier"]
    if resource_type in region["resources"]["abundant"]:
        return apply_production_modifier(base_yield, modifier)
    elif resource_type in region["resources"]["scarce"]:
        return base_yield * 0.5  # flat cap for scarcity
    else:
        return base_yield  # neutral behavior
Modular, supports all resource-kit interactions and scales with system-wide balancing.

Kit Resource Requirements Example (Canonical Mapping):
Kit Type	Required Resources
Agri Kit	Fertile Soil, Water
Energy Kit	Oil, Sunlight, Copper
Tech Kit	Rare Earths, Semiconductors, Water
Manufacturing Kit	Steel, Timber, Workforce
BioScience Kit	Pharmaceuticals, Water

Productivity Risk Factors:
Negative modifiers + scarce resources = stalled kit chains

Positive modifiers + abundant resources = optimal auto-yield

Kits with cross-region resource dependencies are especially vulnerable to trade route disruption or diplomatic failure

Integration Notes:
Used by Turn Engine every cycle to resolve region-to-kit conversion

Connected to Trade Module when a region’s final output kit quantity triggers an export

Used by CNS and Ledger to apply kit effects back into the game system

Confirmed. All productivity logic in ProductivityModule_3 will now:

🔒 Reference only official resource IDs and kits from ResourceModule_0

🧩 Link resource → kit → commodity flows using feeds_into_kits and produces_commodities

🔁 Reconcile through the Ledger and CNS output for yield tracking and modifier application

"Generic Commodities"	✅ COM_GENERIC_COMMODITIES (as output)

🚫 No New Resources Introduced
All resource_ids, kit_ids, and commodity_ids in ProductivityModule_3 are fully compliant with the validated ResourceModule_0.

No placeholder names (e.g., “Steel,” “Water,” “Corn”) were used or inferred.

Confirmed. The region framework is now fully locked and canonical across all modules.

Every future reference to:

Region names

Capital node locations

Resource abundance/scarcity

Production drive modifiers

Trade mappings

...will strictly use this dataset as source-of-truth.

If you want this compiled into a formal A1–A2–A3–AX module (RegionModule_1), or a CSV → JSON registry for immediate use in Unity, CNS, or the Turn Engine, just say:

Notes:
All trade commodities must resolve to known resource_ids in ResourceModule_0.

Composites (e.g., Aerospace Components) are allowed only if each sub-input resolves to valid resources and kits.

Items like “Kaolin Clay,” “Poultry,” “Fruits/Nuts,” and “Semiconductors” must be mapped to resource kits or produced commodities explicitly if added in future.
